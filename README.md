RECONFIGURATION TO REDUCE POWER CONSUMPTION

Power consumption reduction for servers has gained immense importance due to the enormous amount of energy consumed by the data centers and server clusters. To enable this optimization, there must be dynamic reconfiguration of the system resources such that there is no trade off between power consumption and the required quality of service. This project deals with developing the intelligence used to adapt the system to its current requirements and the associated actions that result in optimization of power minimization. Based on the data collected with regard to performance and power consumption, a model has been developed to reconfigure the system resources in order to achieve maximum energy efficiency.
